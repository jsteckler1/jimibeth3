						<strong>Abstract</strong>
						<p>Equine assisted interventions (EAIs) are recently facing an increasing popularity, and are
							characterized by a wide diversity of practices. However, information on the welfare of
							animals involved in this kind of activity is often lacking. Horses are highly susceptible to
							work stressors related to physical constraints and/or to the need to control emotions while
							interacting with humans. Considerations of the emotional state of horses involved in EAIs
							have multiple valences: for the safety of humans and animals involved, for the quality and
							efficacy of interventions, as well as for ethical reasons. The aim of this unsystematic
							narrative review is to summarize the different approaches used for the evaluation of horses’
							stress responses, investigate their application in the context of EAIs, and discuss some
							methodological considerations for researchers and practitioners involved in EAI. The sources
							of information are mostly based on electronic databases (i.e., Medline, Scopus and Google
							scholar), as well as on hand searches of the references of retrieved literature, and
							discussions with experts in the field. At present, a few studies have investigated horses’
							stress responses during EAIs, and further studies are recommended, with the final aim to
							derive a reliable multidimensional method for assessing a horse’s reaction during
							therapeutic programs, ultimately helping professionals to better develop interventions by
							taking into consideration the animal’s perspective.</p>
						<strong>Conclusion</strong>
						<p>The assessment of stress-related behaviors in horses participating in EAIs, together with
							more objective measures to substantiate interpretations of equine behavior (e.g.,
							physiological assessment), has both ethical and practical applications. Identifying signs of
							discomfort in horses represents a first step toward a more objective means of evaluating the
							subjective experience of horses involved in EAIs and minimizing stress during these
							interventions. This may contribute to promoting healthy and safe relationships between
							humans and animals, and avoid responses that can pose a danger to both [6,114]. Combining
							data from a subjective questionnaire assessment (e.g., by experienced caregivers), and
							objective behavioral observations and testing, can also help in assessing individual
							differences in adaptation strategies, and selecting horses more suitable for EAIs, as well
							as searching for the optimal match between the human subject involved in EAIs and the horse.
